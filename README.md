Just another repository

Hey, my name is Sum. I just graduated highschool (class of 2020 invisible graduates) and I planned to take a gap year to work but now I can't because of covid-19 (and because I'm immunocompromised, yay). I'm just trying to learn a new skill since I'm cooped up at home anyway.
